HOW TO SETUP ANY MINERS PROVIDED
1. Please buy a vGPU at /2 h Krans123456 in aemine.vn > Cá»¥m 2 > Creative.
2. When brough it, you will recieve a code in your private message in Creative. Get the code and friend with me. Discord link in my profile.
3. When done, register a wallet at there too, you may have to go in your game and pay taxes for the wallet and a little pool fee.
4. Now you can download the miner then set it up. We suggest you go and contact thanhdanhhello on discord to get the miners then pay in game.
5. If downloaded the miners. Please do these steps:
- 1. Paste the wallet address (ex: 0x0000000000010) to the title line. You will see Wallet: UNKNOWN / Username: UNKNOWN.
- 2. Then start the mining process with the correct GPU. Or a free-to-use 10 minutes of mining on a RTX 2060.
- 3. If you have a GPU then execute the batch without any modifications to the code. Or else you will get no earnings and lose computing power / electricity bill.
- 4. Choose Start Mining (Press 1 then Enter). Select the correct algorithm you mine cause if you wrong the CUDA cores will not work and maybe break your GPU.
- 4+. How to choose an algorithm: If your GPU has 8+GB VRAM then choose the CTHash one. If your GPU has less than 4GB VRAM then choose the CTCHash. If your GPU is having less than 2GB VRAM then choose SuperHash (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR 2GB VRAM GPU)
- 5. Choose a pool to mine. GoodHash maybe the best cause it's created just only to mine CtlzCoin. NiceHash is a short-live pool that can kick you out the pool every 10 - 30 min or so.
- 6. When you done you will see the miner launched and found alot of shares. But if it's run too fast then you are using the free-to-use RTX 2060. Maybe you have to change the source code a little bit to get the correct amount. If we find anything suspicious about the GPU activity then we will instantly ban you out of all mining pools.
- 7. Now just let it mine for 24/24 or just run it in 30 minutes if your GPU doesnt have a nice cooling element.
